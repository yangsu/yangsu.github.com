## Introduction {#introduction}

**Precise behavior** can emerge from **imprecise knowledge** because:

1. **Information is in the world**: behavior is determined by combining information in memory with that in the world
    - **Declarative Knowledge (knowledge of)**: facts and rules, easy to write down and teach
    - **Procedural Knowledge (knowledge how)**: knowledge in the subconscious, difficult to teach, impossible to write down, taught through demonstration
2. **Great Precision is not required**: perfect behavior will result if the knowledge describes information or behavior sufficiently to distinguish the correct choice from others
3. **Natural Constraints**: physical properties of objects constrain possible operations
4. **Cultural Constraints**: societal conventions that govern acceptable behavior

## Memory

Constraints reduce the amount of knowledge required in memory to produce or reproduce perfect behavior

**Short Term Memory (STM)**: 5 - 8 items of memory of the present, fragile, prone to distractions
**Long Term Memory (LTM)**: memory of the past as interpreted through our understanding of them. Difficulty is with organization and retrieval

### How people use memory and retrieve information
1. Memory of Arbitrary Things: rote learning creates problems, definitely not the way to go
    - it takes considerable time and effort to learn
    - when a problem arises, the memorized sequence of actions gives no hint to what's wrong or how to fix it
2. Memory from Meaningful Relationships: when things have a sensible structure they correspond to previous knowledge, so the new material can bu understood, interpreted, and integrated. Rules and constraints can be used to organize information and reduce memory load
3. Memory THrough explanation: constructing mental models to understand and remember the world and information, predict new results

### Aids

### Reminders
Must include both of the following to be effective:
- **signal**: something is to be remembered
- **message**: remembering what it is

### Predictions

TODO

### Labels
If a design depends on labels, it may be faulty. Labels are important and often necessary, but the appropriate use of natural mapping can minimize the need for them. Whenever labels seem necessary, consider another design

Reasons for the existence/purchasing of badly designed products:
- usability is not often thought of as a criterion during purchase, unless you test it, it's difficult to notice usability issues
- purchaser may not be the user and make decisions based on other factors
- it's sometimes necessary to trade one desirable feature for an undesirable one
