<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

This chapter of [The Design of Everyday Things][poet] introduces and formalizes basic concepts and principles of design from observations of everyday objects. Why some objects, as simple as doors, please their users while others frustrate them.

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

- **<span id="visibility">Visibility</span>**: correct parts must be visible, they must convey the correct messages; indicates the mapping between *intended actions* and *actual operations*

- **<span id="affordance">Affordance</span>**: the perceived and actual properties of the thing, primarily the fundamental properties that determine how it can be used. *Affords* = *"is for"*

    *Examples*:

    ![horizontal bar <em>affords</em> pushing (www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/minimize-errors-part-i)][push-bar]

    ![vertical bar <em>affords</em> pulling (www.flickr.com/photos/redsquirrel/4870919966/sizes/m/in/photostream)][pull-handle]

- **<span id="system-image">System Image</span>**: the visible part of a device or system

- **<span id="mental-model">Mental Models</span>**: the models people have for themselves, others, the environment, and things with which they interact. Formed through experience, training, instructions, or by interpreting perceived actions and the [System Image](#system-image)

- **<span id="mapping">Mapping</span>** : the relationship between two things
*Example*: controls ⇒ their resulting movements and the effects in the physical world

- **<span id="natural-mapping">Natural Mapping</span>**: [mapping](#mapping) that takes advantage of physical/spatial analogies and cultural standards
    *Examples*:

    ![Rising Level ⇒ More][rising-level]
    ![Diminishing Level ⇒ Less][diminishing-level]

    - **Additive Dimensions**: add more to show incremental increases

        *Examples*: amount, loudness, weight, length, brightness, etc.


    - **Substitutive Dimensions**: substitute one value for another to make a change

        *Examples*: pitch, taste, color, location

- **<span id="feedback">Feedback</span>**: sending back information to users about what actions have been performed
*Example*:
    ![Phones provide lots of feedback][phone]
    - Tactile feedback of buttons
    - Tones mapped for each button
    - Clicks, tones, to inform state and progress of a call or operation
    - *Sidetones*, the voice signal feedback into the ear to help regulate loudness

<h2 id="principles-of-design">Principles of Design</h2>

1. Provide a good conceptual model
  - The proper [System Image](#system-image) and immediate [feedback](#feedback) for each operation can help users form a clear, concise, and correct [mental model](#mental-model)
2. Make Things Visible
  - Use good [natural mappings](#natural-mapping) and proper [visibility](#visibility) to help the user understand of possible operations, their effects, and the system state
  - The number of controls should be ≧ the number of functions a device performs, so each can be specifically mapped to a particular function

<h2 id="designers-responsibility">Designer's Responsibility</h2>

The Designer must balance the conflicting needs of others that help realize a product design:

- *Manufacturer*: the product can be produced economically and efficiently
- *Store*: the product should be attractive to customers
- *Purchaser*: the price, appearance, prestige value of a product at the Store
- *User*: the functionality and usability of a product at home
- *Repairer*: the product's maintainability; how easy it is to take apart, diagnose, and service

<h2 id="the-paradox-of-technology">The Paradox of Technology</h2>

The same technology that simplifies life by providing more functions in each device also complicates life by making the device harder to learn and use
